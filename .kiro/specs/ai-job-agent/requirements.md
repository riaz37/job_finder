# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Job Agent is an intelligent job application system built with FastAPI backend and Streamlit frontend that automates the entire job search and application process. Users upload their resume through the Streamlit interface, set preferences, and the AI agent finds relevant jobs using JobSpy, optimizes resumes for specific positions, generates personalized cover letters, and automatically submits applications. The system provides a comprehensive Streamlit dashboard for tracking applications and managing user preferences, with FastAPI handling all backend processing and API endpoints.
